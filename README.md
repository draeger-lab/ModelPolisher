ModelPolisher accesses the [BiGG Models knowledgebase](http://bigg.ucsd.edu) to annotate and autocomplete [SBML](http://sbml.org) models.
Thereby, the program mainly relies on [BiGG identifiers](https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/wiki/BiGG-Models-ID-Specification-and-Guidelines) for model components.
In addition, it fixes some obvious errors in the models.

An online version of this program is available at https://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de: Just click on the program's icon and upload a file using the link on the left.

ModelPolisher is essentially a command-line based tool. You can run it locally using your own installation of BiGG Models database (see https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models). A list of all available command-line options is printed when starting ModelPolisher with the option `-?`, i.e., by typing `java -jar ModelPolisher-VERSION.jar -?`, where "VERSION" needs to be replaced with the current release version of the program. If you run into trouble with larger files, especially _java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded_, please use the jvm Xmx flag (e.g. `java -Xmx4G -jar ModelPolisher-VERSION.jar` ).
