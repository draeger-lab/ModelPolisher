Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

name: traceable author statement
def: "A type of author statement that is based on a cited reference." [ECO:MCC, GO:TAS]
comment: The traceable author statement (TAS) evidence code covers author statements that are attributed to a cited source. Typically this type of information comes from review articles. Material from the introductions and discussion sections of non-review papers may also be suitable if another reference is cited as the source of experimental work or analysis. When annotating with this code the curator should use caution and be aware that authors often cite papers dealing with experiments that were performed in organisms different from the one being discussed in the paper at hand. Thus a problem with the TAS code is that it may turn out from following up the references in the paper that no experiments were performed on the gene in the organism actually being characterized in the primary paper. For this reason we recommend (when time and resources allow) that curators track down the cited paper and annotate directly from the experimental paper using the appropriate experimental evidence code. When this is not possible and it is necessary to annotate from reviews, the TAS code is the appropriate code to use for statements that are associated with a cited reference. Once an annotation has been made to a given term using an experimental evidence code, we recommend removing any annotations made to the same term using the TAS evidence code.

For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

comment: In Illumina sequencing technology, adapters are ligated onto the ends of randomly fragmented DNA.

To begin the sequencing cycle, labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase are added, followed by laser excitation of the fluorescent label and high resolution scanning. After non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away and the dye is chemically removed, the next cycle repeats with four labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase, again followed by imaging.

Within each droplet, a single DNA template is attached to a single primer-coated bead. Each bead is subsequently captured in a picolitre well within the sequencing machine. A luciferase-based readout system is used to identify individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA.\n\nThe target strand is usually prepared by fragmentation, adaptor ligation, and amplification by emulsion PCR.

comment: SOLiD sequencing technology is based on sequencing by ligation. After library preparation, emulsion PCR and bead enrichment are performed, including 3' modification of templates on selected beads to allow covalent bonding to a slide. 3' modified beads are attached to a glass slide and primers are added. Four fluorescently labeled di-base probes are added and multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed. The number of cycles determines read length. After a number of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and another round of ligation cycles is performed with a new primer complimentary to the n-1 position of the template. Five rounds of primer reset are performed for each sequence tag.\n\nSamples are prepared by fragmentation of a sample library, adaptor ligation, emulsion PCR, and attachment of resultant beads to glass slides.

[OBI:0000695]
comment: Chain termination sequencing, also called Sanger sequencing after its developer, uses dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators. Single-stranded DNA template, DNA primer, DNA polymerase, fluorescently or radioactively labeled nucleotides, and one of four ddNTPs are added together in each of four separate sequencing reactions. The synthesized and labeled DNA fragments from each of the four reactions are denatured, separated by size by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography or UV light.\n\nThe ddNTPs lack an OH group so the next dNTP cannot be attached, causing chain termination.

All types of chromosome conformation capture technology involve five primary steps: cross-linking of DNA in vivo, restriction digestion, intramolecular ligation, reversing cross-linkages, and DNA enrichment and quantitation. The last step is different for each type of chromosome conformation capture technology, and may include PCR (3C), inverse PCR (4C), or ligation-mediated amplification (5C). Methods for product quantitation can include agarose gel detection or real-time quantitative PCR in the case of 3C, or high-throughput sequencing or microarray analysis for 4C and 5C.

comment: Hi-C is used to study the structural properties and spatial organization of chromosomes inside cells. Hi-C is similar to other types of chromosome conformation capture technology, but involves the addition of biotinylated nucleotides during the second or fourth step and enrichment for ligated fragments using immunoprecipitation after the fourth step.

def: "A type of combinatorial analysis that is used in a manual assertion." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Combinatorial analyses could include experimental or computational results. Examples include: (i) large-scale experiment such as a genome-wide two-hybrid or genome-wide synthetic interactions; (ii) integration of large-scale data sets of various types; and (iii) text-based-computation, e.g. text-mining. For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

To achieve this anti-sense knockdown technique, delivery of the morpholino can be achieved via microinjection, electroporation, or another method.

comment: SELEX begins with the synthesis of a large oligonucleotide library, either single-stranded DNA or RNA, which consists of random fixed-length sequences flanked by constant 5' and 3' ends that serve as primers. The library is exposed to a target ligand, typically a protein or small organic compound. Unbound sequences are removed, typically with affinity chromatography. Bound sequences are eluted and the nucleic acid is extracted, followed by PCR amplification (RNA is first reverse transcribed). PCR product is converted to single stranded (DNA) or transcribed (RNA). Oligonucleotides are bound to the ligand again and the process is repeated with increasing elution stringency. After several rounds of the process, recovered oligonucleotides are sequenced and analyzed to reveal the binding specificity of the protein.

comment: Bacterial one-hybrid assay is a method for screening a library of candidate proteins (prey plasmid) for the ability to bind to a target, cis-regulatory element or any other short, DNA binding sequence placed 5' to reporter genes (bait plasmid). Transformation of a bacterial host with two different plasmids is required: One is designed to express the "bait". The other plasmid contains a "prey" which, if bound to by the chimeric fusion product, drives expression of downstream reporter genes.

comment: Total RNA is isolated from cells and mRNA is purified by targeting the 3' polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail with poly(T) oligos covalently attached to a substrate. Next, cDNA fragments are generated either by hydrolysis of RNA into 200-300 base oligonucleotides, preceded by reverse transcription, or by reverse transcription initiated by random primers. The cDNA second strand is synthesized, fragments are adapter ligated and high-throughput sequencing is performed by Roche 454, Illumina, ABI-SOLiD, or another HT sequencing technology. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

comment: Complementary DNA (cDNA) is synthesized from microgram quantities of mRNA using first-strand cDNA primer (oligo dT12-18) and reverse transcriptase in the presence of trehalose and sorbitol, followed by selection of full-length cDNA with biotinylated cap-trapper. Linkers are attached to the 5' ends of full-length enriched cDNAs to introduce a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease MmeI, which creates a two base overhang. After amplification, sequencing tags are concatenated for high-throughput sequencing. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

def: "A type of transcript expression evidence based on high-throughput (HT) sequencing of the 5' ends of cDNA molecules that are selected by reverse transcriptase template switching." [ECO:MCC]
comment: NanoCAGE captures the 5' ends of molecules by template switching. When polymerizing the cDNA of a capped mRNA, the reverse transcriptase adds extra cytosines that are complementary to the cap. Each 5' full length cDNAs is extended upon hybridization of the riboguanosine-tailed template switching oligonucleotides to these extra cytosines. In semisuppressive PCR, the short templates fold intramolecularly and prevent the binding of primers, which precludes amplification; longer molecules are less likely to fold and are thus amplified. Templates derived from reaction artifacts form stable homoduplexes, also precluding amplification. After template switching, semisuppressive PCR, and EcoP151 cleavage, 25-bp tags are ligated to bar code-containing oligonucleotide adaptors. After PCR amplification, the nanoCAGE tags are sequenced by synthesis. NanoCAGE requires as little as 10 nanograms of total RNA.

Typically, polypeptides bound with SDS possess an even distribution of charge per unit mass, and subsequent fractionation is by size.

comment: The first dimension gel is intentionally run at low voltage in low percentage agarose to separate DNA molecules in proportion to their mass. The second dimension is run at high voltage in a gel of higher agarose concentration in the presence of ethidium bromide so that the mobility of a non-linear molecule is drastically influenced by its shape.

def: "A type of RNA-seq evidence where intron locations in predicted transcripts are compared to intron locations supported by RNA-seq evidence." [ECO:MCC]
comment: RNA-seq alignment intron location evidence is used by NCBI RefSeq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq). Exon-exon boundaries (or intron locations) of a RefSeq transcript, as determined by aligning the transcript to a reference chromosome, are compared to intron locations supported by RNAseq data.

def: "A type of support of intron position by RNA-seq alignment evidence where RNA-seq alignment from a single sample supports all of the intron positions (exon pairs) predicted for a transcript." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Full support entails that all exon pairs represented in the transcript are supported. For example, for a transcript containing five exons, if liver RNA-seq reads support all four introns but brain RNA-seq supports only three introns, then the liver data fully support the transcript exons whereas the brain data do not.

def: "A type of support of intron position by RNA-seq alignment evidence where RNA-seq alignment to a genome supports only some of the intron positions (exon pairs) predicted for a transcript." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Partial support can occur in two ways. First, one or more exon-exon pair (intron) is not supported by any RNA-seq sample included in the analysis. Second, no single RNA-seq sample provides support for all exon-exon pairs (introns) represented in a transcript, but all represented exons are supported by at least one sample.

def: "A type of evidence where an assertion is derived from another assertion via logical inference or some non-logical but rational means." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, or alternatively, arriving at conclusions via some non-logical means of observation of patterns of facts, which can result in identifying new meanings and contexts for understanding. Given the evidence provided by a set of premises, deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions that necessarily follow, i.e. are certain, whereas inductive reasoning generates conclusions that are likely to be, but are not necessarily, true.

comment: In DNAse footingprinting amplified DNA combined with TF and DNAse is electrophoresed for fragment comparison with a non-TF control sample. TF-bound fragments do not appear in the gel. Such fragments can be isolated, purified, and sequenced. This technique is often used to identify the binding motif of a TF resolving the protected region to 50-100 bp which can be further examined for TF-binding sites.

[ECO:SW, PMID:20232898]
comment: The degree of polarization of a fluorophore is inversely related to its molecular rotation. When the fluorophore is bound to a small molecule, the rate at which it tumbles can decrease significantly from when it is bound tightly to a large protein. If the fluorophore is attached to the larger protein in a binding pair, the difference in polarization between bound and unbound states will be smaller and less accurate. The degree of binding is calculated by using the difference in anisotropy of the partially bound, free, and fully bound states measured by titrating the two binding partners. Fluorescence polarixation assays are homogeneous.

comment: When ITC is used to study TF, the temperature of two identical cells containing a known concentration of TF is monitored.

This value can be used to compute the energetics of the reaction and hence, binding affinity of the TF for the DNA fragment.

comment: Differences in the optical path lengths between a surface layer and a buried silica layer can be measured very precisely allowing optical height information to be converted to accumulated mass on the surface. For the purpose of TF-binding site identification, IRIS is coupled with DNA-arrays with immobilized potential binding regions exposed to the protein of interest and eluted. Protein-bound fragments exhibit changes in reflectance that can be used to gauge binding quantitatively.

comment: Relationship type between sequences (e.g. orthologs from multiple genomes or co-expressed genes in the same genome) is not necessarily assumed. The local multiple sequence alignment is typically ungapped. A common application of motif discovery is to infer the binding motif of a given transcription factor (TF). This can be based on the results of a whole-genome expression analysis, assuming that co-expressed genes are co-regulated by the same TF, from peaks in ChIP-seq experiments with the TF, or from the comparative genomics analysis of the promoter regions of orthologs. {xref="PMID:19892760", xref="PMID:23032607"}

comment: There are significant differences in data analysis and data evaluation if to compare a HTP mass-spec and a regular mass-spec. The regular mass spec method is quite a reliable technique for identifying a protein molecular weight and analysing its post-modifications, other mass-spec applications might require the additional quality controls and more stringent data evaluation. More complex sample mixture is processed, more quality questions should be addressed, such as a sample contamination and sensitivity of the mass spectrometer while using HTP mass-spec.\nFor HTP mass-spec, the analysis of the small data sets allows to manually assign the spectra to proteins or peptides, but for large data sets only the statistical tools can be used instead.

comment: DNA fragmentation in response to apoptotic signals is achieved through the activity of apoptotic nucleases. In human, these include DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) or caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and endonuclease G (Endo G) (reviewed in PMID:15723341). Caution is needed when apoptotic DNA laddering assays show presence of fragmented DNA. A positive assay may simply reflect the end point of a whole apoptotic process. Unless clear experimental evidence is available to show that a gene product is directly involved in fragmenting DNA, please do not annotate to GO:0006309 'apoptotic DNA fragmentation' and consider annotating instead to a more upstream process such as, e.g., GO:0042981 'regulation of apoptotic process', GO:0006915 'apoptotic process', GO:0097190 'apoptotic signaling pathway'. Also, note that gene products involved in compartmentalization of apoptotic nucleases and in activation or repression of their enzymatic activity should be annotated to the regulation term GO:1902510 'regulation of apoptotic DNA fragmentation' or to one of its children (see PMID:15723341).

name: cell death
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)." [GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:25236395]
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.

comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children, which are descendants of GO:0034050 'host programmed cell death induced by symbiont'.

Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:\n\n(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.\n\n(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.\n\n(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.\n\nIn the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.  " xsd:string

Percent specific killing was determined with the following equation: (experimental 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100." xsd:string
