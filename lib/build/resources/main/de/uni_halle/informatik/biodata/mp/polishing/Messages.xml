    <entry key="BOUNDARY_FLAG_MISSING">Species {0} is supposed to be on the system"s boundary, but its boundary condition flag was not correctly set.</entry>
    <entry key="CHANGE_COMPART_REFERENCE">Changing compartment reference in species {0} from {1} to {2} so that it matches the compartment code of its BiGG id {0}.</entry>
    <entry key="CHANGED_NAME">Changed name {0} to {1}</entry>
    <entry key="CHECK_MASS_BALANCE_DESC">When set to true, the mass balance of each reaction will be checked where possible. Reactions that are recognized as peudoreactions are excluded from this check, also are reactions that lack information about elementary composition of their participants.</entry>
    <entry key="COMPARTMENT_CODE_WRONG_FORMAT">"CompartmentCode {0} does not conform to BiGGId standard"</entry>
    <entry key="CREATE_MISSING_COMP">Creating compartment {0} because it is referenced by {2} {1} but does not yet exist in the model.</entry>
    <entry key="OBJ_FLUX_OBJ_MISSING">Objective {0} does not have any flux objectives</entry>
    <entry key="OBJ_MISSING">No objectives defined for model {0}.</entry>
    <entry key="PROCESSING_MODEL">Processing model {0}.</entry>
    <entry key="TOO_MUCH_OBJ_TARGETS">Only one reaction should be the target of objective {0}.</entry>
    <entry key="TRY_CONV_LVL3_V1">Trying to convert the model to Level 3 Version 1.</entry>
    <entry key="UPDATE_GP_ID">Updating the id of gene product {0} to {1}.</entry>

    <entry key="ADD_GENERIC_TERMS_DESC">Set this option to true if generic top-level annotations, such as 'process' should not be applied. Not using those terms will reduce the size of the resulting output file.</entry>
    <entry key="SBML_VAL_DESC">If true, the created SBML file will be validated through the online validator service at http://sbml.org.</entry>

    <entry key="PARSE_GPR_ERROR">Could not parse {0} because {1}</entry>

    <entry key="VAL_ERR_COUNT"><![CDATA["There {0,choice,0#are no errors|1#is one error|1<are {0,number,integer} errors} in file {1}."]]></entry>
    <entry key="VAL_ERROR">No SBML validation possible, process terminated with errors.</entry>
    <entry key="VAL_OFFLINE">Validating {0} using offline validator.</entry>
    <entry key="VAL_OFFLINE_FAIL">Failed reading file {0} for offline validation.</entry>
    <entry key="POLISH_EVEN_IF_MODEL_INVALID">Run the polishing module on the document, even if it is invalid after potential fixing. Generally, this is not recommended and most likely to cause the ModelPolisher to fail.</entry>
